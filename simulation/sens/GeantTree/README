This folder contains the source code for a program that 
reads the output of an st_mona/n2_geant simulation and
generates plots to compare the ToF and partial inverse
methods (p-inv) for reconstructing fragment KEs. The
.root files on which the program operates are specifed
starting at line 648 of GeantTree.h. This program is
functionally similar to the PreGeant program, it just
operates on a different .root file so that the results
of the GEANT simulation can be included.

NOTE: the additional files thr_cosy_map.hh,
UtilFunctions.hh and Binning.h are located at
../PreGeant/ and the include statements at the
start of GeantTree.C need to be updated accordingly.

Descriptions of the source code files are given
here.

GeantTree.C:
  - Defines physical constants
  - Set ranges for histograms
  - Define histograms
  - Initialize arrays to hold fragment parameters
  - Set up ion-optical matrix for forward tracking
  - Set up partial inverse matrix for inverse tracking
  - Loop over entries:
      + Apply forward transformation (DV method)
      + Apply full inverse transformation (DV method)
      + Fill histograms for post target distributions
      and CRDC distributions
      + Compute post-target fragment velocity
      + Apply forward transformation (ST method)
      + Apply partial inverse transformation
      + Calculate p-inv KE and velocity
      + Compute neutron velocity from their KEs after
      the target
      + Calculate fragment velocity/KE via ToF method
      + Fill histograms for ToF reconstruction
      + Fill histograms for relative velocity
      distributions
  - Plot histograms

GeantTree.h
  - Set pointers for histograms
  - Set up ROOT class for the input file

thr_cosy_map.hh
  This is a modified version of the header file that
  defines the cosy_map class for st_mona. It was
  modified to read the .map and .imap files into
  arrays instead of the cosy_map class structure.
  These arrays are then used to perform the ion-
  optical transformations.

UtilFunctions.hh
  This file contains some simple functions to format
  the histograms produced by PreGeant.C

Binning.h
  This file holds the definitions for the histogram
  ranges and binning options.

saveprofiles.C
  A macro to save out the histograms generated by
  PreGeant.C. It requires the savefig() function
  defined in utils_THR.C
