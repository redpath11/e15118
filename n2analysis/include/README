CRDC# calibration files are indexed 1,2: 1 = part 1 before
venting the focal plane box; 2 = part 2 after venting

HOPE TDC calibrations are currently used

mona(lisa)_locations.hh have been updated with the results of
the survey conducted by Dave Sanderson on 30 October 2017

lisaMeans.out contains the means of the neutron x positions for
bars with > 300 counts. These values are used to force these
distributions to 0 by adding an offset to the bar x location

mona_variables.hh contains all the include statments needed to
pass calibration settings and locations to the source code. This
is also where the global tmean offsets are set.

sweeper_variables (two versions, before and after venting)
contains include statements and calibration parameters needed
by the sweeper section of the source code.
	part#_sweeper_variables.hh (#=1, before venting; #=2
	after venting)

tmean_offsets.h contains the individual tmean offsets for each
bar. Currently used are the NSCL offsets calculated from a
single cosmic run. There is also a version from HOPE that used
the paddle runs to extract individual tmean offset.
